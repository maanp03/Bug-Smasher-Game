# 🐞 Bug Smasher Game

**Bug Smasher** is a fun and interactive browser-based game built entirely with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. Developed during my second semester, the game was created to showcase my front-end development skills, DOM manipulation, and responsive interaction handling.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Players are challenged to smash as many moving bugs as possible within a limited time. Each bug click increases the score, and the game gets progressively faster, testing the player’s reflexes.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **JavaScript** – Game logic, timers, animations, event handling  
- **HTML** – Game layout and structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and animations for an engaging UI  

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ Timed gameplay with countdown  
- 🐜 Randomized bug movement  
- 🖱️ Click interaction to "smash" bugs and score points
